## User Guide for Draft

### Best Way to Use:

1. **Click "Sort by Variance"** button (top right) - Shows boom/bust potential
2. **Look for GREEN variance badges** (150+) - These are explosive players
3. **Check "Upside" column** - Gap between weekly high and average
4. **Target players with**:
   - Variance 150+ (green badge)
   - Upside 10+
   - 20+ weeks played (availability)

### Key Metrics:

- **Variance**: Boom/bust potential (higher = more explosive games)
  - GREEN (150+): Elite boom potential
  - YELLOW (80-150): Solid upside
  - GRAY (<80): Consistent but limited ceiling

- **Upside**: Points above average in their best weeks
  - 10+: Excellent draft value
  - 5-10: Good
  - <5: Limited upside

- **Peak**: Single best week performance
- **Avg High**: Average of their best weekly scores
- **Floor**: Worst weekly score (injury/rest risk indicator)

### Fantasy Scoring Formula:
```
Points + Rebounds + (2 × Assists) + (3 × Blocks) + (3 × Steals)
```

## Verification Commands

If you want to verify data accuracy:

```bash
cd /Users/zac/zac_ecosystem/apps/high_score_basketball

# Check Jokić
bin/rails runner "
jokic = Player.find(141)
puts \"Games: #{jokic.game_logs.count}\"
puts \"Points: #{jokic.game_logs.sum(:points)}\"
puts \"Date range: #{jokic.game_logs.minimum(:game_date)} to #{jokic.game_logs.maximum(:game_date)}\"
"

# Check for playoff games
bin/rails runner "
puts \"Games after Apr 14, 2024: #{GameLog.where('game_date > ?', Date.parse('2024-04-14')).count}\"
"

# Check date distribution
bin/rails runner "
GameLog.group(\"strftime('%Y-%m', game_date)\").count.sort.each { |m, c| puts \"#{m}: #{c}\" }
"
```
